AMQP

RabbitMQ is an open-source message-broker software (sometimes called message-oriented middleware) that originally implemented 
the Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP) and has since been extended with a plug-in architecture to support Streaming Text Oriented Messaging Protocol (STOMP),
MQ Telemetry Transport (MQTT), and other protocols

RabbitMQ created on the basis of the Open Telecom Platform system, written in Erlang,
uses Mnesia as a database engine for storing messages.

AMQP (Advanced Message Queuing Protocol) is an open protocol for transferring messages between system components. 
The main idea is that individual subsystems (or independent applications) can 
exchange messages in an arbitrary way through an AMQP broker that performs routing,
possibly guarantees delivery, distribution of data streams, and subscription to the required message types.
The protocol architecture was developed by John O'Hara of JP Morgan Chase & Co
